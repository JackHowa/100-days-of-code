# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4, 2017, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** Made a 1-dimensional tic tac toe solution finder. Based off a friend's flatiron challenge whereby board input with output of how the person won.

**Thoughts:** Felt like a lot of time in that seemingly basic concepts (node list iteration, js event listener) took longer than I expected - good timed-test practice. Liked building something quick. Pretty ugly end result though; hardly usable with the underscores and no directions. Also it'd be super easy to fill in an underscore based on the button. Feel like I could have spent a tiny bit of time prettifying it so that it will make a nicer tweet.
