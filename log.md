# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4, 2018, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** Made a 1-dimensional tic tac toe solution finder. Based off a friend's flatiron challenge whereby board input with output of how the person won.

**Thoughts:** Felt like a lot of time in that seemingly basic concepts (node list iteration, js event listener) took longer than I expected - good timed-test practice. Liked building something quick. Pretty ugly end result though; hardly usable with the underscores and no directions. Also it'd be super easy to fill in an underscore based on the button. Feel like I could have spent a tiny bit of time prettifying it so that it will make a nicer tweet.

### Day 2: March 5, 2018, Monday  

**Today's Progress:** Made a 2-demensional tic tac toe simulated player. Based on fcc curriculum for dumb computer opposition. Struggled to make a move per time. Also the random position player turned out to be more difficult than expected, using math and sample and lodash. Nodelists are difficult. 

**Thoughts:** Feel good. Woke up early at 6 and meditated beforehand. Feel oddly supported by the twitter thing. Struggled to get going inititially while making breakfast. Need to meditate first. Initially wanted to make a react-ify tic tac toe. But maybe that will be a next step once I get basic js working.

### Day 3: March 6, 2018, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress:** Minimal so far (35 minutes in). So far, learned that jquery and react working together is an [anti-pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43586830/react-js-binding-click-event). 

Ended the day strong: a finishing 30 minutes to keep going with jQuery and ES2015, including async-await. Basic functionality of the game complete. Have one more [user story requirement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game) via free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** Thought this would be easier, mixing with React. You always hear about how compatible React is with everything. Thought I could easily mix state transfer with jquery with react props.

Feel much better about getting something working and at least utilizing something new in JS.

### Day 4: March 7, 2018, Wednesday 

**What did you like?** I liked working with react now. It's fun when you're working on the cutting edge. Feel like it will run faster too. JSX is much cleaner than js and html.
**What was lacking?** I was lacking some self-control to not look at the [react tutorial for tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It's tough because I had a good start. Then I started getting bad code smells for react. That's when I looked for react guides. 
**What did you learn?** I learned about creating a kind of constructor for child components. 
**What do you long for going forward?** To have a good balance of refactoring based on best practices and swift learning.

### Day 5: March 8, 2018, Thursday 

**Liked?** Finally getting a somewhat dry string interpolation working. Felt good getting some coding in on a busy day.
**Lacked?** Good sleep and time management. Maybe could have coded on the train?
**Learned?** That string interpolation with regex can be tricky. Named groups in regex is not a thing yet. 
**Longed for going forward?** An earlier set time. Was stressed out about client meeting so maybe over-psyched with running and going out the night.

### Day 6: March 9, 2018, Friday 

**Liked?** Getting some of the tests to pass. It's gone along with my work today using ssn regex and other validation. 

**Lacked?** Code quality. The regex has been spiraling out of control. Now it's looseness is coming back to haunt because of potential conditional checks. 

**Learned?** That you can will yourself to code. Whenever. At whatever hour or state of mind, with practice.

**Longed for going forward?** A better schedule of going about this. Struggling to fit this into normal day. Maybe that's the point that I'm exceeding the normal schedule on a Friday night hehe.

### Day 7: March 10, 2018, Saturday 

**Liked?** Got all the tests to pass, albeit with helper method.

**Lacked?** Need to bring all the regex groups together. 

**Learned?** Good on me for asking for help on fcc glittr. Feels good getting that review with console logging the regex string that's created. 

**Longed for going forward?** Should make more of a plan instead of going test-by-test in the challenge. An all-encompassing solution should just work.

**Link to work:** [phone regex](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/validate-phone-nums.js)

### Day 8: March 11, 2018, Sunday

**Liked?** Adding comments to a relatively simple challenge - and doing it the best way 

**Lacked?** Doing it right the first time. Guess that's part of coding. 

**Learned?** Should reassess refactoring as I build an mvp. 

**Longed for going forward?** Keeping on going with js and fcc feels good. 

**Link to work:** [record handling](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/record-collection.js)

### Day 9: March 12, 2018, Monday

**Liked?** Liked working with dash docs. much clearer knowing the source. great explanaations too. feels good to get things done when you wouldn't think it's possible 

**Lacked?** didn't like turbulence while coding. probably could have gotten this work done at the airport where I had wifi to push 

**Learned?** this is kind of meditative

**Longed for going forward?** Coding on an airplane is last option.

**Link to work:** [symmetric pairs fcc challenge](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/symmetric-pairs.js)

### Day 10: March 13, 2018, Tuesday

***Liked*** Worked at the hotel. 

***Disliked*** Didn't like working in bed before sleep.

### Day 11: March 16, 2018, Friday

**Liked?** Working next to Lauren.

**Lacked?** The math background to initially grasp what symmetric difference was. The question seemed to make it difficult to realize how to scale the problem.

**Learned?** Math and symmetric difference

**Longed for going forward?** Refactoring the solution based on my new understanding.

**Link to work:** [symmetric pairs fcc challenge](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/symmetric-pairs.js)

### Day 12: March 19, 2018, Monday 

**Liked?** Working next to Lauren for half of it after work. Was a good warm-up doing some in the morning before working. Have to get back into the coding mindset. 

**Lacked?** Didn't realize an obvious initial misunderstanding due to lack of end testing. Worked on a middle thing without the big thing and the little thing's programmatic logic.

**Learned?** pop and unshift can work well together. Need to visualize with my hands sometimes the order of things. It brought back to mind the roman numerals logic but having started with roman numeral letters. 

**Longed for going forward?** Quicker early tests using fcc. Will want to rename the variables more verbosely not using acronyms so that I don't initially misunderstand.

### Day 13: March 20, 2018, Tuesday

***Liked*** getting two days in a row again. Feels bad not doing a day. Fun talking through the algorithm in my head with Lauren. 

***Learned*** that it's important to build features. But it's more important to build what's needed for the tests to pass. 

***Lacked*** the steadiness to do this earlier in the day, maybe in the morning. Though it was nice to linger in bed early. Didn't like working in bed.

***Longed for*** not having to feel like I need to treasure all moments with family and fiancee. It's difficult to make time for coding when you want to also spend as much time with family and friends.

### Day 14: March 22, 2018, Thursday

***Liked*** Working alongside Lauren. Being fresh to work.

***Learned*** Trying to refactor following the same logic can lead down similar pitfalls. 

***Lacked*** Quick refactor and following same logic again. Need to pseudocode and separate logic more.

***Longed for*** Quick checks of the same logic. Don't want to jump into problem too quickly.

### Day 15: March 26, 2018, Monday

***Liked*** Having more time to work on the project 

***Learned*** Pseudocode is key! 

***Lacked*** Going through and debugging poorly named variables. Sometimes just need to start from first principles maybe. 

***Longed for*** Pseudocode from the start!! 

**Link to work:** [exact change](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/exact-change.js)

### Day 16: March 28, 2018, Wednesday

***Liked*** Getting in flow, getting second wind after work 

***Learned*** js number type error is hard. clear the cache if oddity at work on fcc :) 

***Lacked*** Went down stack overflow hole trying to use magic on it, rather than refactor

***Longed for*** Getting this stinking problem done. Feel much better about it.

**Link to work:** [exact change](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/exact-change.js)

### Day 17: March 29, 2018, Thursday

***Liked*** Coding on the train. Nice to get a start before work on something useful. 

***Learned*** Coding while hungry on the way back from work is no fun. 

***Lacked*** A big project or something fun to work. Guess exact change is fun. Refactor was good but needed more structural improvement. 

***Longed for*** Work with big o and algorithmic improvement. 

***Link to work:*** [exact change](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/exact-change.js)

### Day 18: March 30, 2018, Friday 

***Liked*** the satisfaction of setting up a unique url

***Learned*** to focus on the smaller parts of the question of dns, not the whole shebang 

***Lacked*** a quick start way of doing it with hover and github pages. 

***Longed for*** an internal doc that could be super quick to setup

### Day 19: March 31, 2018, Saturday 

***Liked*** building a portfolio site using react. Think I was using some decent design patterns for react, using a render function. 

***Learned*** about static class methods in react. There was a ide developer suggestion to use the static method. Since it was a class-method, and wasn't being used dynamically. Didn't use this functionality. 

[benefits of static class methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static)

***Lacked*** a thorough understanding of the react design pattern I was going for. In this way, it would be more useful it I had tutorial based knowledge. 

***Longed for*** quick deploy to the github pages.

User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

### Day 20: April 1, 2018, Sunday 

***Liked*** eating sour patch while I worked. 

***Learned*** that the first jump on an algorithm is not always the best, again. Had a good restart to pseudocode here. 

***Lacked*** array built-in knowledge without internet access. 

***Longed for*** my dad to drive less like a pissed off teenager. Tried to code in the car again. 

***Link to work:*** [inventory update](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/inventory-update.js)


### Day 21: April 3, 2018, Tuesday 

***Liked*** refactoring the alphabetize with a nice built-in and new comparison that felt right for 2017. Liked working on the train to work. Liked Lauren's support even though I missed April 2.  

***Learned*** about locale compare and sort. Keep up with the gh-pages and installing that. It's tough but gh-pages and uploading to hover works. 

***Lacked*** scheduled plan for when I work on 100 days of code.

***Longed for*** more mental clarity to work on this.

### Day 22: April 4, 2018, Wednesday 

***Liked*** deploying the React updated site. 

***Learned*** about const components for React. A bit about why to setup Firefox Developer Addition and items in CSS Grid. 

***Lacked*** clear, interesting way of styling them. Want to take the css grid course. Had a little extra time left after some refactoring on react; maybe shouldn't have watched css grid tutorial for 15 minutes. But not the end of the world. 

***Longed for*** simple deploys to gh-pages.

### Day 22: April 5, 2018, Thursday 

***Liked*** working with Lauren on her code. Also, it was fun working in Python - a new language for me. Also, obscuring text and encouragement hehe. 

***Learned*** that python 2 and 3 are different - especially on the forums. To check for variable naming before trying a new task. Those dev work and prototyping quickly can get in the way. 

***Lacked*** a clear understanding of what the different parameters for the import and libraries used in python. 

***Longed for*** collaboration with Lauren all the time. That'd be fun. Also a really solid computer that was reliable. Also, one that I had the charger for right now ... lol have to get my work computer's charger at work now. Was previously going to work from home - oops.

### Day 23: April 7, 2018, Saturday 
***Liked*** making time on the weekend, even when I was distracted. 

***Learned*** that the difference between permutation and combination is that permutation's position does matter. A "combination" lock should actually be called a "permutation lock" because a lock's order matters. Also, if distracted, do push-ups. 

***Lacked*** a good schedule today and yesterday to do this. Also, an understanding of the math-y algorithms required for this. 

***Link to work*** [permutation calculator](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/no-repeats-plz.js)

### Day 24: April 8, 2018, Sunday 

***Liked*** knocking it done for the day. Was too late at night and frustrated before I even started. 

***Learned*** don't code when you're not doing well. 

***Lacked*** focus and clear of mind. Was antsy coding standing up as well. 

***Linked*** nuthin

### Day 25: April 9, 2018, Monday 

***Liked*** Gatsby js wow. Feels good getting going with a React project.

***Learned*** github pages can be temperamental but configuring cname each time does work.

***Lacked*** wider scope of understanding of gatsby js. 

***Linked*** [gatsby portfolio](http://jackhowa.com)

### Day 26: April 10, 2018, Monday 

***Liked*** working before I went to work and waking up early. Just have to get started then I'm good. 

***Learned*** that following tutorial after watching is a good idea to do mini-learning along the way. 

***Lacked*** a project focus for the css grid. 

***Linked*** [css grid tutorial](https://github.com/JackHowa/css-grid/blob/master/03%20-%20CSS%20Grid%20Fundamentals/css-grid-fundamentals-START.html)
