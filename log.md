# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4, 2018, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** Made a 1-dimensional tic tac toe solution finder. Based off a friend's flatiron challenge whereby board input with output of how the person won.

**Thoughts:** Felt like a lot of time in that seemingly basic concepts (node list iteration, js event listener) took longer than I expected - good timed-test practice. Liked building something quick. Pretty ugly end result though; hardly usable with the underscores and no directions. Also it'd be super easy to fill in an underscore based on the button. Feel like I could have spent a tiny bit of time prettifying it so that it will make a nicer tweet.

### Day 2: March 5, 2018, Monday  

**Today's Progress:** Made a 2-demensional tic tac toe simulated player. Based on fcc curriculum for dumb computer opposition. Struggled to make a move per time. Also the random position player turned out to be more difficult than expected, using math and sample and lodash. Nodelists are difficult. 

**Thoughts:** Feel good. Woke up early at 6 and meditated beforehand. Feel oddly supported by the twitter thing. Struggled to get going inititially while making breakfast. Need to meditate first. Initially wanted to make a react-ify tic tac toe. But maybe that will be a next step once I get basic js working.

### Day 3: March 6, 2018, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress:** Minimal so far (35 minutes in). So far, learned that jquery and react working together is an [anti-pattern](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43586830/react-js-binding-click-event). 

Ended the day strong: a finishing 30 minutes to keep going with jQuery and ES2015, including async-await. Basic functionality of the game complete. Have one more [user story requirement](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game) via free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** Thought this would be easier, mixing with React. You always hear about how compatible React is with everything. Thought I could easily mix state transfer with jquery with react props.

Feel much better about getting something working and at least utilizing something new in JS.

### Day 4: March 7, 2018, Wednesday 

**What did you like?** I liked working with react now. It's fun when you're working on the cutting edge. Feel like it will run faster too. JSX is much cleaner than js and html.
**What was lacking?** I was lacking some self-control to not look at the [react tutorial for tic-tac-toe](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It's tough because I had a good start. Then I started getting bad code smells for react. That's when I looked for react guides. 
**What did you learn?** I learned about creating a kind of constructor for child components. 
**What do you long for going forward?** To have a good balance of refactoring based on best practices and swift learning.

### Day 5: March 8, 2018, Thursday 

**Liked?** Finally getting a somewhat dry string interpolation working. Felt good getting some coding in on a busy day.
**Lacked?** Good sleep and time management. Maybe could have coded on the train?
**Learned?** That string interpolation with regex can be tricky. Named groups in regex is not a thing yet. 
**Longed for going forward?** An earlier set time. Was stressed out about client meeting so maybe over-psyched with running and going out the night.

### Day 6: March 9, 2018, Friday 

**Liked?** Getting some of the tests to pass. It's gone along with my work today using ssn regex and other validation. 

**Lacked?** Code quality. The regex has been spiraling out of control. Now it's looseness is coming back to haunt because of potential conditional checks. 

**Learned?** That you can will yourself to code. Whenever. At whatever hour or state of mind, with practice.

**Longed for going forward?** A better schedule of going about this. Struggling to fit this into normal day. Maybe that's the point that I'm exceeding the normal schedule on a Friday night hehe.

### Day 7: March 10, 2018, Saturday 

**Liked?** Got all the tests to pass, albeit with helper method.

**Lacked?** Need to bring all the regex groups together. 

**Learned?** Good on me for asking for help on fcc glittr. Feels good getting that review with console logging the regex string that's created. 

**Longed for going forward?** Should make more of a plan instead of going test-by-test in the challenge. An all-encompassing solution should just work.

### Day 8: March 11, 2018, Sunday

**Liked?** Adding comments to a relatively simple challenge - and doing it the best way 

**Lacked?** Doing it right the first time. Guess that's part of coding. 

**Learned?** Should reassess refactoring as I build an mvp. 

**Longed for going forward?** Keeping on going with js and fcc feels good. 

**Link to work:** [record handling](https://github.com/JackHowa/front-end-certificate/blob/master/advanced-sorting-algorithms/record-collection.js)

### Day 9: March 12, 2018, Monday

**Liked?** Liked working with dash docs. much clearer knowing the source. great explanaations too. feels good to get things done when you wouldn't think it's possible 

**Lacked?** didn't like turbulence while coding. probably could have gotten this work done at the airport where I had wifi to push 

**Learned?** this is kind of meditative

**Longed for going forward?** Coding on an airplane is last option.

### Day 10: March 13, 2018, Tuesday

***Liked*** Worked at the hotel. 

***Disliked*** Didn't like working in bed before sleep.

### Day 11: March 16, 2018, Friday

**Liked?** Working next to Lauren.

**Lacked?** The math background to initially grasp what symmetric difference was. The question seemed to make it difficult to realize how to scale the problem.

**Learned?** Math and symmetric difference

**Longed for going forward?** Refactoring the solution based on my new understanding.
