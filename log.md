# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 4, 2017, Sunday 

**Today's Progress:** Made a 1-dimensional tic tac toe solution finder. Based off a friend's flatiron challenge whereby board input with output of how the person won.

**Thoughts:** Felt like a lot of time in that seemingly basic concepts (node list iteration, js event listener) took longer than I expected - good timed-test practice. Liked building something quick. Pretty ugly end result though; hardly usable with the underscores and no directions. Also it'd be super easy to fill in an underscore based on the button. Feel like I could have spent a tiny bit of time prettifying it so that it will make a nicer tweet.

### Day 2: March 5, 2017, Monday  

**Today's Progress:** Made a 2-demensional tic tac toe simulated player. Based on fcc curriculum for dumb computer opposition. Struggled to make a move per time. Also the random position player turned out to be more difficult than expected, using math and sample and lodash. Nodelists are difficult. 

**Thoughts:** Feel good. Woke up early at 6 and meditated beforehand. Feel oddly supported by the twitter thing. Struggled to get going inititially while making breakfast. Need to meditate first. Initially wanted to make a react-ify tic tac toe. But maybe that will be a next step once I get basic js working.
